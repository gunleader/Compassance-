WORK IN PROGRESS:
- Language file. It's working but I'm not very happy
	with the implementation. I'm not comfortable
	with releasing something that may be changed
	frequently yet.
- Specialized themes. They are really cool but I'm also
	working on finalizing the API.

PLANNED:
- Offline mode support.
- UUID tracking.
- Entities/animals tracking.
- Tracking menu revamp.
- Location preset.
